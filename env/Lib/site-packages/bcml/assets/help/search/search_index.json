By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.</p> <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p> <p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p> <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p> <p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:</p> <ol> <li>assert copyright on the software, and</li> <li>offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute      and/or modify it.</li> </ol> <p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.</p> <p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p> <p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p> <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>"},{"location":"LICENSE/#terms-and-conditions","title":"TERMS AND CONDITIONS","text":""},{"location":"LICENSE/#0-definitions","title":"0.

A BNP mod starts with normal game content folders, using the structure documented above. When creating a BNP, BCML scans the mod content for edited files. Then, for any file supported by one of BCML's mergers, BCML will analyze the file and compare it to the version from the vanilla game. Each merger will create a log file (e.g. <code>rstb.json</code>) of changes detected and store it in a <code>logs</code> folder at the root of the BNP. If the changes made to a file can be completely reproduced from the log alone, that file will be deleted from the BNP. This includes files inside of SARC archives. Files which are not in the vanilla game, or modified files for which there is no merger in BCML, will be left alone.</p> <p>The end result is a 7z archive containing (1) one or more content folders with only edited files not handled by BCML remaining and (2) a set of merger logs. Most of the logs are stored as YAML files, though JSON is also used. This means a BNP can be opened and extracted with 7-Zip, and many of the logs will be readable to anyone familiar with YAML-based BOTW modding tools.</p> <p>When the BNP is installed, BCML will extract its contents into an internal mods directory and process the logs inside to apply the changes to vanilla or existing merged files.
